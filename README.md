Speaking clock
==============

Specification
-------------
1. Given a 24 hour clock convert the current time into words
	e.g. "08:34" should be converted to "It's eight thirty four"

2. Return Midday and Midnight as "It's Midday" and "It's Midnight"

The time allotted to the test is 1 hour. Your solution will be judged on a number of criteria pertinent to good
software development practice. Incomplete solutions are acceptable.

Please note any assumptions you make, or any further questions you have regarding the requirements.

Current Implementation Assumptions
----------------------------------
- input validation has been performed already
- only deal with the simple case of translating the time; however, the code is in a state in which it is easy
to add new translation strategies in order to improve (e.g. 21:00 -> It's 9 o'clock pm)
